<h1>
<center> The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</center>
	</h1> 
<p>
<center>
	From western Philadelphia I hail
<br>
Where in my youth I'd play upon the green 'til - rue the day!
<br>
I found myself assail'd by ruffians contemptible and mean.
<br>
Although the spat was trivial and brief,
It wounded my dear mother deep within;
<br>
And so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
She sent me forth to live amongst her kin.
<br>
When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
I came upon a coachman most unique;
<br>
And yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
Despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
<br>
I survey all the land with princely mien
In fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.
